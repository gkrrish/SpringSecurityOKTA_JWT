If you add the RestController along with Maven Spring security dependency, then 
Default Spring boot will add the Login page, BASIC AUTHENTICATION we could call this.















Eclipse:

Go to "Window" > "Preferences".
In the preferences window, navigate to "Java" > "Compiler" > "Errors/Warnings".
Expand the "Deprecated and restricted API" section.
Set "Deprecated API" to "Error", "Warning", or "Ignore" to specify how deprecated API usages should be treated.
Click "Apply and Close" to save the changes.


By configuring these settings in your IDE, deprecated methods and APIs will either be hidden or marked according to your preference, helping you avoid using them accidentally while coding with the latest Spring version
