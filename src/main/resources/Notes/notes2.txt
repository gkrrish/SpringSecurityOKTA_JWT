CSRF :

Imagine you're logged in to your bank's website (Site A) on one browser tab. In another tab, you visit a malicious website (Site B). Site B might try to trick your browser into unknowingly performing actions on Site A (like transferring money) using your logged-in session.

CSRF Protection:
---------------

Spring Security's CSRF protection helps prevent such attacks.
It adds a special CSRF token to your web pages.
When you submit a form (e.g., login form), the browser includes this token along with the form data.
Spring Security validates the token, ensuring the request genuinely originated from your browser and not a malicious site.
